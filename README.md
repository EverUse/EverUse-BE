<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Everuse partners with gyms, retailers, and manufacturers throughout the climbing industry to collect and upcycle used climbing rope into high-quality products. We aim to reduce waste, extend the lifespan of climbing rope, and minimize the environmental footprint of the climbing industry. By offering sustainable products, we strive to become the go-to brand for climbers who are passionate about both their sport and the planet. We aim to form partnerships and provide funding to organizations that are dedicated to maintaining access, restoration, and safety in climbing.

The back end application is an API built with the Rails framework and PostgreSQL database. It exposes 3 POST endpoints utilizing GraphQL and is responsible for receiving requests, querying the internal database, and formatting JSON responses to send data to the front end application.

Our Production Site is available [here](https://everuse-fe-c2ebec288f10.herokuapp.com/)

<!-- Technical Solutions -->
## Technical Solutions:
As part of the Capstone project requirements, the EverUse backend team challenged ourselves to stretch technologies during the 14-day design and development process. We selected the following based on the challenges we anticipated facing while building out our MVP, and adjusted our choices to reflect our individual and team learning goals as well as blockers that came up during the course of working on the project.

### GraphQL
* Challenge: An ecommerce site can have hundreds if not thousands of inventory items that vary by size, color, and more. And using REST APIs often means numerous API calls to request specific items based on specific conditions, which can result in unnecessary data transfer and decreased efficiency and performance.
* Solution: With GraphQL the frontend has the flexibility to fetch exactly the data they need from just one endpoint `/graphql`, reducing the number of network requests and improving performance. In total, we have provide three GraphQL operation responses to the frontend -- one query response with all products, one query to response with only products by a given attribute (such as name), and one mutation response to let the user know that an order request email submission was successful.

### SendGrid
* Challenge: When a user on the frontend submits an order request form, it sends a post mutation query to the backend. The challenge here was to find an API that we could utilize to send emails to the customer to ensure that order details were received and that the company had a way to get in touch with the customer about their order.
* Solution: Twilio's Sendgrid email API along with ActionMailer allows us to send an email styled with HTML/CSS to the customer with the order details they filled out in their request form.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- Roadmap -->
## Roadmap
Additional features, functionality, and potential refactors:
  * Future considerations for features include the potential to add an admin portal for the company to log in, manage orders and inventory, and directly fulfill orders.
  * Additionally, implementing a payment solution that would allow the user to directly pay for the items through the app.
